# Heredity

- Reproductive Processes and Variation
  - New individuals are similar yet subtly different
  - Variation produced during:
    - Asexual reproduction (minor)
    - Sexual reproduction (maximized)
  - Examples:
    - Sugarcane (asexual): little variation
    - Animals, humans (sexual): distinct visible variation
  - Focus: Mechanisms that create and inherit variation

- Accumulation of Variation During Reproduction
  - Inheritance from previous generation:
    - Provides basic body design and subtle changes
  - With each new generation:
    - Inherit differences from parents
    - Acquire newly created differences
    - More pronounced in sexual reproducers
  - Asexual reproduction (example):
    - Minor differences arise from DNA copying inaccuracies
    - Diversity generated over generations, but less than in sexual reproduction
  - Sexual reproduction:
    - Greater diversity generated due to more rule-based inheritance
  - Environmental selection:
    - Variants have different survival chances (e.g. heat-resistant bacteria)
    - Environmental factors select variants, driving evolution

  - **Questions**
    - If trait A is in 10% and B in 60% of asexual population, which arose earlier?
    - How does variation affect survival?

- Heredity
  - Reproductive process primarily creates individuals of similar design
  - Heredity: Rules for reliable inheritance of traits

  - Inherited Traits
    - Children bear basic species features, but not identical to parents
    - Human populations display great variation

    - **Activity 8.1**
      - Observe earlobe types (free/attached)
      - Correlate student earlobe types with parental types
      - Suggest rule for inheritance of earlobe types

  - Rules for the Inheritance of Traits
    - **Mendel’s Contributions**
      - Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884)
        - Monastery education, science/math at Vienna
        - Failed teacher exam, returned to research
        - Grew peas, kept count of traits per generation
        - Established laws of inheritance using pea plant traits:
          - Visible pairs: round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short, white/violet flowers
      - Mendel's cross-breeding results:
        - F1 generation (first filial): Only one parental trait appears (no intermediates)
        - Self-pollination of F1: F2 generation, 1/4 display the other trait (shows both traits inherited, only one expressed)
        - Led to:
          - Traits controlled by two “factors” (now genes), contributed equally by parents
          - Factors can be identical or different
        - Dominant and recessive traits:
          - Dominant: Expressed with just one copy (e.g. ‘T’ for tall)
          - Recessive: Expressed only if both copies are recessive (e.g. ‘t’ for short)
      - **Activity 8.2**
        - Confirm 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt, and tt in F2 generation

    - Independent Inheritance of Two Traits
      - Crossing two different characteristic plants (e.g. tall/round x short/wrinkled)
        - F1: All tall, round (dominant)
        - F2: Some new combinations (tall/wrinkled, short/round)
        - Traits inherited independently (shape and colour, etc.)

  - Expression of Traits
    - Cellular DNA codes for proteins; a gene = DNA section for one protein
    - Example: Tallness controlled by hormone, which is affected by gene-coded enzyme efficiency
    - Both parents contribute DNA equally in sexual reproduction
      - Each gene exists in two copies (one from each parent)
    - Germ-cells (egg/sperm):
      - Only one gene set (halved via meiosis)
      - Combine at fertilization to restore normal number
    - Chromosome arrangement:
      - Genes found on chromosomes (separate DNA pieces)
      - Two copies of each chromosome (one from each parent)
      - Germ-cells get one chromosome from each pair (random maternal/paternal choice)
    - Explains Mendel’s results; applies to all organisms

  - Sex Determination
    - Different strategies in different species:
      - Environmental cues (reptiles: temperature affects sex)
      - Programme switching (snails: can change sex)
      - Genetic determination (humans)
    - Human sex determination:
      - 22 pairs of autosomes + 1 pair of sex chromosomes
      - Women: XX (homologous pair)
      - Men: XY (heterologous pair)
      - Inheritance:
        - All children inherit X from mother
        - Father contributes X (girl) or Y (boy)
        - Sex of child determined by which chromosome is contributed by father

    - **Questions**
      - How do Mendel’s experiments show dominant/recessive traits?
      - How do Mendel’s experiments show independent inheritance?
      - Blood group inheritance scenario: What can/can't be concluded about dominance?
      - How is human sex determined?

- Summary ("What you have learnt")
  - Variations during reproduction can be inherited
  - Inherited variations may enhance survival
  - Sexual reproducers have two gene copies per trait; expressed trait is dominant, hidden is recessive
  - Traits can be inherited independently, creating new combinations
  - Sex determination factors vary by species; in humans, determined by paternal X (girl) or Y (boy)
